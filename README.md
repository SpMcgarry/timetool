I needed to give myself a visual of multiple time zone within a calandar. 
started this to learn how to create and manipulate as well as how the compiler reacts to time aspects. 
Decided to not use the time libraries and build from scrach first then ill learn the libraries after.

trying to calculate difference in time zones , create a tool to display variances and figure out how to display time without the time libraires first then 
figure out what other tools i can make after.
