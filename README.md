I needed to give myself a visual of multiple time zone within a calandar. 
started this to learn how to create and manipulate as well as how the compiler reacts to time aspects. 
Decided to not use the time libraries and build from scrach first then ill learn the libraries after.
As i progress i will make point to keep the fixme notes and add details on problem resolution 

Purpose: figure out methods to compare , compute time in python first without time based libraries see what works what doesnt and 
what tools can come from this. First bassis is figuring difference in time zones based on input
